## 1. Prisma & Database

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix Pattern | Prevention Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prisma Client fails in Cloudflare Workers runtime** (BL-072) | PrismaNeonHTTP adapter has runtime incompatibility with Cloudflare Workers edge environment; all `prisma.*` calls fail with 500 errors in production but work fine locally in Node.js | Replace all Prisma Client calls with raw SQL using `@neondatabase/serverless`; change imports from `@/lib/prisma` to `@/lib/db` and use template literal SQL queries | Never use Prisma Client in Cloudflare Workers/Pages deployments; use raw SQL via Neon's HTTP client; test on actual Cloudflare runtime, not just local Node |
| **Auth helper breaks all API routes** (BL-073) | `requireAuth()` in `src/lib/auth-api.ts` used `prisma.user.findUnique()`; when called at start of every authenticated route, this caused ALL API endpoints to fail with 500 errors | Convert auth helper to use raw SQL: `SELECT id, role, org_id FROM users WHERE email = $1` | Auth helpers are called by EVERY route — they must use edge-compatible code; validate auth paths work in production before testing business logic |
| **WASM client import** (BL-058) | `prisma.ts` imported `@prisma/client/wasm`; Node.js rejects `.wasm` extension, all DB writes silently no-op | Import from `@prisma/client`; reserve WASM import for Cloudflare Workers build only | After initial setup, execute an explicit DB write and verify it persists before moving on |
| **Implicit transaction with Neon HTTP adapter** (BL-059) | `create({ include: {...} })` triggers an implicit multi-statement transaction; Neon HTTP transport does not support transactions, throws opaque error | Split into `create()` then `findUnique()` as two separate calls | With Neon HTTP adapter, never use `create+include` or any implicit transaction pattern; use only single-statement operations |
| **Schema enum not regenerated** (BL-067) | Added `VOICE` to `SimulationType` enum but skipped `npx prisma generate`; generated client still had stale type definitions | Run `npx prisma generate` then restart dev server | Make `prisma generate` + dev server restart a mandatory post-schema-change step; do not test until both are done |
| **Missing FK indexes** (BL-052) | PostgreSQL does not auto-index foreign key columns; `session_id`, `user_id` etc. caused sequential scans on every transcript query | Add explicit `@@index` declarations in Prisma schema for all FK columns | Add FK indexes as a standard checklist item whenever a relation is created |
| **Global unique instead of scoped unique** (BL-056) | `job_titles.name` had `@unique` globally; in multi-tenant context, organisations legitimately share names | Change to `@@unique([orgId, name])` | In multi-tenant schemas, always scope unique constraints to `(orgId, fieldName)` |
| **Missing cascade deletes** (BL-057) | No `onDelete: Cascade` on Session→Messages, Session→Scores, JobTitle→Scenarios; SQL deletes leave orphaned rows | Add `onDelete: Cascade` to all parent→child relations in schema | Define cascade behaviour at schema creation time, not retroactively |
| **Column name mismatches in raw SQL** (BL-074) | Used `sc.created_at` when scores table has `scored_at`; used `s.simulation_type` when column is `type`; used `jt.updated_at` when job_titles has no such column | Always reference Prisma schema when writing SQL; use actual database column names (snake_case) not Prisma field names (camelCase) | Before writing any SQL query, check `prisma/schema.prisma` for exact column names; never assume column names match field names |
| **INSERT missing `gen_random_uuid()`** (BL-078) | All `id` columns are `TEXT NOT NULL` with **no DB DEFAULT** — the database will not auto-generate IDs. Every `INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...)` must supply `gen_random_uuid()` explicitly. 4 POST routes were missing this, causing 500 errors on every create operation | Add `gen_random_uuid()` as the first value in the `VALUES` clause of every INSERT: `INSERT INTO criteria (id, name, ...) VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), ...)` | After writing any new INSERT statement, grep the VALUES clause for `gen_random_uuid()` — even if other tables have it, never assume. Keep a pre-merge grep: `grep -rn "INSERT INTO" src/app/api/ \| grep -v gen_random_uuid` |

## 2. AI & External APIs

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix Pattern | Prevention Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **groq-sdk fails in Cloudflare Workers** (BL-075) | `groq-sdk@0.9.1` requires Node.js `http.Agent.maxCachedSessions` API which doesn't exist in Cloudflare Workers runtime; all AI calls throw `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'maxCachedSessions')` in production; polyfills fail because OpenNext bundles/optimizes code at build time, making runtime patches ineffective | Replace `groq-sdk` with custom fetch-based client (`src/lib/groq-fetch.ts`) using native `fetch()` API; implement both non-streaming (`chatCompletion`) and streaming (`chatCompletionStream`) methods; remove `groq-sdk` from dependencies | Before adding ANY NPM package to Cloudflare Workers project, verify it has zero Node.js runtime dependencies; prefer packages explicitly marked as edge-compatible; when in doubt, build a minimal fetch-based wrapper instead |
| **Deprecated Groq model name** (BL-050) | `llama3-70b-8192` was removed by Groq; calls silently errored | Update to `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | Store model name in an env var; monitor Groq deprecation notices; never hard-code model strings |
| **Inverted CUSTOMER/AGENT roles** (BL-060) | Telnyx webhook saved AI messages as `AGENT` and trainee speech as `CUSTOMER`; scoring and replay used wrong roles | Swap role assignments to match logical ownership | Write a unit test asserting role assignment for both message directions immediately after implementing any message-storage pathway |
| **Wrong script field names** (BL-061) | Webhook accessed `script.persona` / `script.objective` (undefined) instead of `script.customerPersona` / `script.customerObjective`; AI had no persona context | Correct field names to match `ScenarioScript` type | Use typed property access (`script.customerPersona` via the TypeScript type) — never access scenario fields via untyped string keys |
| **Wrong Groq history role mapping** (BL-062) | History mapped with `m.role === 'USER'` but DB stores `'AGENT'`/`'CUSTOMER'`; all history resolved to `assistant`, stripping user context | Map using correct DB role constants | Use `MessageRole` enum constants when mapping roles; add a role-mapping unit test |
| **Unbounded session turns** (BL-053) | `ScenarioScript.maxTurns` defined in type but never checked; sessions run indefinitely, consuming unbounded Groq calls and DB rows | Count agent turns before each Groq call; end session when `maxTurns` is reached | Always implement resource limits (turn cap, token budget, timeout) alongside the resource that consumes them |
| **Schema field stored but never used in AI logic** (BL-079) | `criteria.weight` (1–10) was saved to the DB and shown in the admin UI, but the `scoreSession()` prompt never mentioned it — all criteria were treated as equally important regardless of weight | Include `[importance: X/10]` per criterion in the scoring prompt; compute all averages as weighted means `sum(score×weight)/sum(weight)` | When adding a data field to a schema, trace its full lifecycle (store → prompt → aggregate → display); if any step is missing, the field is misleading to users |
| **Dead code: exported function never imported** (BL-087) | `getNextCustomerMessage()` was exported from `src/lib/ai.ts` but never imported anywhere in the codebase; misleads future developers into thinking it's the active call path | Remove unused exports or add a `@deprecated` JSDoc comment | After adding any exported function, verify at least one import site exists within a week; use `grep -rn "getNextCustomerMessage" src/` |
| **Telnyx `gather_using_speak` rejects empty `payload`** (BL-088) | `callGather()` sent `payload: ''` as the TTS text to `gather_using_speak`; Telnyx rejects the request, throwing an error that is silently swallowed by the outer `try/catch` in the webhook handler. Result: no `call.gather.ended` event ever fires and the call goes completely silent after the AI speaks the opening line | Pass a minimal SSML break as the payload: `'<speak><break time="200ms"/></speak>'`. This activates the TTS engine without producing audible speech, satisfying Telnyx's validation while keeping STT mode active | Never pass an empty or blank string as `payload` to any Telnyx TTS/gather action; use an SSML break instead. When testing a phone call, always listen for whether the AI *re-prompts* after each response — silence after the opening is the hallmark of a failed gather |
| **`speech_timeout_millis` is not a valid Telnyx parameter — STT mode never activates** (BL-089) | `callGather()` used `speech_timeout_millis` (typo/guess), which Telnyx silently ignores. Without the real parameter `speech_end_timeout`, the `gather_using_speak` action defaults to DTMF-only mode — it listens for key-presses, not speech. `call.gather.ended` either never fires or fires with an empty transcript, so no trainee speech is ever captured and the conversation loop dies after turn 1 | Replace `speech_timeout_millis` with `speech_end_timeout` (silence-after-speech timeout in ms). Also add `speech_recognition_language: 'en-US'` and `minimum_phrase_duration: 500` to ensure the STT engine is fully activated | When integrating any external API, use only parameter names that appear verbatim in the official docs — never guess or copy a similar-looking name. For Telnyx STT, the required activation parameter is `speech_end_timeout`; without it the endpoint silently falls back to DTMF | 
| **Feature divergence: phone path missing chat-path fixes** (BL-081/BL-082) | Chat route (`/api/chat`) received `buildSessionSystemPrompt` + `scoreSession` wiring, but the Telnyx webhook maintained a separate local 4-line stub `buildSystemPrompt` that was never updated. Phone sessions had a `// TODO` score comment — scoring never actually ran | The webhook must import and call the same shared functions from `@/lib/ai`: `buildSessionSystemPrompt` for prompts and `scoreSession` on resolve | Any feature added to the chat path must be simultaneously mirrored in the Telnyx webhook; treat them as a pair; add a checklist item: "phone ↔ chat parity" |

---

## 3. Authentication & Identity

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix Pattern | Prevention Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Credentials provider accepts any username** (BL-047) | `authorize()` returns a user object for any non-empty string; anyone knowing the sign-in URL can claim any identity including `admin` | Add proper user lookup and role verification in `authorize()` | Never ship a credentials provider that accepts arbitrary input; use OAuth or verified credentials |
| **`dbUserId` always null** (BL-048) | Dual identity model: NextAuth `userId` (string) and `dbUserId` (FK to `User` table) coexist; `User` table is never populated on sign-in, making the FK permanently null | Upsert `User` on sign-in in the NextAuth `signIn` callback; set `dbUserId` FK on session creation | Decide and document the canonical user identity FK before building any session or history features |
| **Unguarded API routes** (BL-046) | All `/api/*` routes serve unauthenticated requests; any caller can read transcripts or create sessions | Add auth middleware to all API routes | Auth guard is the first line of every new route handler — add it before any business logic |

---

## 4. Browser APIs & Frontend

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix Pattern | Prevention Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stale closure in SpeechRecognition callbacks** | `finalTranscript` state captured at callback-creation time; `onend` always saw the initial empty string | Maintain a `finalTranscriptRef` updated in `useEffect`; read the ref inside event callbacks | Never read React state inside async browser event callbacks; always bridge via a ref |
| **Wrong CSS keyframe for waveform animation** | Tailwind `bounce` uses `translateY` (vertical jump); audio bars need `scaleY` from bottom anchor | Custom `@keyframes bar-wave` using `scaleY` + `transform-origin: bottom` | Verify the exact CSS property required before reaching for a utility class; animate scale/origin separately |
| **UI reads field name that doesn't match API response** (BL-083) | `GET /api/jobs/[id]/criteria` returns `{ id, name, ... }` but the admin UI read `d.criteriaId` — always `undefined`. The "Linked" vs "Add" badge always showed "Add" for every criterion regardless of actual state | Match UI field access (`d.id`) exactly to what the API `RETURNING`/`SELECT` clause emits | After writing a new API endpoint, trace every field alias to the UI consumer that reads it; grep for the camelCase version of every returned key |
| **Hardcoded API path in UI button** (BL-084) | Admin debug panel had a "Test GROQ" button calling `fetch('/api/test-groq')` — a route that never existed (404). Should have been `/api/debug/groq` | Use a constant or search for the actual route file before hardcoding a URL | Before shipping any UI button that calls a specific API path, verify the route file exists with: `find src/app/api -name "route.ts" \| xargs grep -l "<keyword>"` |
| **Score aggregation inconsistency across pages** (BL-085) | Analytics page used weighted mean but session detail page used a simple mean and didn't even fetch `c.weight` from the DB. The same score looked different depending on which page you were on | All score aggregation points must use `sum(score×weight)/sum(weight)`, and `weight` must be included in every SQL query that feeds a score display | Any page displaying a score total must fetch `weight` and use the weighted mean formula; grep for `reduce.*score` to find unchecked aggregations |
| **Admin forms silently swallow API errors** (BL-086) | `save()` and `remove()` in all 4 admin tabs call `fetch()` but never check `res.ok`; on a 500 the function calls `refresh()` as if the operation succeeded — no user feedback, no error toast | After every `fetch()` in a mutation handler, check `if (!res.ok) { alert/toast the error; return; }` before calling `refresh()` | Every mutation function (save, delete, link) must have a `res.ok` guard; treat silent success as a bug |

---

## 5. Build & Deployment

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix Pattern | Prevention Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenNext Cloudflare build failure** (BL-045) | `groq-sdk` CJS/ESM interop or `next-auth` v5 + React 19 incompatibility in Cloudflare bundler; build exits with code 1 | Investigate ESM interop shims; track upstream fixes in `@opennextjs/cloudflare` | Run a Cloudflare build in CI on every dependency update, not just before release |
| **Missing `required-server-files.json` → empty Pages deploy** (BL-070) | Next build exited early / hung on type-check; `.next/required-server-files.json` absent, so OpenNext produced a worker with no routes, yielding 404/empty body in production | Ensure `npx next build` completes and `.next/required-server-files.json` exists before running `npx @opennextjs/cloudflare build`; rerun Next build if file is missing | Gate every Pages deploy on a successful Next build that outputs `required-server-files.json`; add a CI check to fail if the file is absent |
| **Pages assets 404 after deploy** (BL-071) | Deployed `.open-next` root instead of `.open-next/assets`; worker ran but `_next/static/...` assets were missing from Pages bucket, causing 404 for CSS/JS/fonts | Deploy with `pages_build_output_dir = ".open-next/assets"` so static assets and `_worker.js` are shipped together | Always point `pages_build_output_dir` to the OpenNext `assets` folder when using Pages advanced mode |
| **`outputFileTracingRoot` lockfile warning** (BL-065) | Next.js detected multiple `package-lock.json` files and emitted noisy warnings on every start | Add `outputFileTracingRoot: path.join(__dirname)` in `next.config.ts` | Set `outputFileTracingRoot` whenever the project root differs from the Next.js app root |
| **Raw JSON editor for non-technical admins** (BL-077) | Scenario script used a raw JSON textarea; non-technical admins found it daunting and error-prone (common feedback: "the JSON window is intimidating") | Replace JSON textarea with labeled form fields, plain-English descriptions, visual difficulty picker, and dynamic hints list; build JSON internally before sending to API | Any admin-facing config that requires structured data should use a form-based UI, not raw JSON; save JSON serialisation for developer-facing tools only |
| **Missing production secrets in Cloudflare Pages** (BL-076) | GitHub Actions workflow deployed code but didn't set runtime environment variables; API keys missing in production, causing silent failures with fallback error messages | Add `wrangler pages secret put` commands to deployment workflow; store secrets in GitHub Actions repository secrets | Every environment variable used in production must be set via `wrangler pages secret put` or Cloudflare dashboard; never assume local `.env` values carry over to production |

---

## 6. Architecture & Design Patterns

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix Pattern | Prevention Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **633-line monolith page** (BL-068/069) | `simulate/[sessionId]/page.tsx` grew to 633 lines with three UI modes inline; became untestable | Extract `useChatSession` hook; split chat, phone, and voice into dedicated components; extract `MessageBubble` | Extract a custom hook at the first sign of complex async state; each distinct UI mode must be its own component |
| **Missing multi-tenancy scope on all queries** (BL-049) | `orgId` columns exist in schema but no API route filters by them; all data is cross-tenant visible | Add `where: { orgId }` to every query; derive `orgId` from the authenticated session | If a multi-tenant schema is in place, every query must scope to `orgId` — enforce via code review checklist or lint rule |
| **Shared helper function never called by a second consumer** (BL-082) | `buildSessionSystemPrompt` was the correct function to use in both chat and phone paths. The Telnyx webhook had its own local stub that was 4 lines vs 30 lines — less prompt richness, inconsistent behaviour, harder to maintain | Export shared AI helper functions from `src/lib/ai.ts`; every entry point (chat route, phone webhook) imports from that single source | When a function is "shared," verify every logical consumer imports it; a local copy is a divergence waiting to happen |

## Recurring Patterns — Quick Reference

| Common Mistake | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Using Prisma Client in Cloudflare Workers** | **NEVER use `prisma.*` in edge runtime — use raw SQL via `@neondatabase/serverless`** |
| **Using NPM packages with Node.js dependencies in Cloudflare Workers** | **Verify packages are edge-compatible before installing; runtime polyfills don't work because bundlers inline code at build time** |
| **Every INSERT needs `gen_random_uuid()` — no DB default exists** | **`id TEXT NOT NULL` columns have no DB DEFAULT; every `INSERT INTO` must include `gen_random_uuid()` in the VALUES clause** |
| **Schema column names vs Prisma field names in SQL** | **Always check `schema.prisma` for actual column names (snake_case) before writing SQL** |
| **Auth helpers with Prisma calls** | **Auth helpers run on EVERY route — must use edge-compatible raw SQL only** |
| Importing Prisma WASM client in Node.js dev | Import `@prisma/client`; WASM only for Workers build |
| Skipping `prisma generate` after schema change | Always run generate + restart before testing |
| Using `create+include` with Neon HTTP adapter | One Prisma operation per HTTP call; no implicit transactions |
| Hard-coding Groq model names | Store in env var; monitor deprecation notices |
| Reading React state inside browser event callbacks | Bridge via ref updated in `useEffect` |
| Global unique constraints in multi-tenant schema | Scope all unique constraints to `(orgId, field)` |
| No FK indexes on new relations | Declare `@@index` for every FK column at creation time |
| No cascade deletes on parent–child relations | Define `onDelete: Cascade` at schema creation time |
| API routes without auth guard | Auth guard is the first thing in every route handler |
| Accessing typed objects via unverified string keys | Use TypeScript typed access; let the compiler catch typos |
| No resource limits on external API calls | Implement turn cap, timeout, or token budget alongside the call |
| Monolith page components mixing multiple UI modes | One UI mode = one component; complex state = one custom hook |
| Missing `orgId` filter on queries | Every query in a multi-tenant system must include `where: { orgId }` |
| Schema field defined but ignored in downstream logic | Trace every new field: store → AI prompt → aggregate → display. Any missing step is a lie to users |
| UI field name doesn't match API response key | Before reading `d.someField` in the UI, verify the exact key emitted by `RETURNING`/`SELECT` in the API |
| Hardcoded API path in UI | Before shipping any fetch call, verify the route file exists; never guess the URL |
| Inconsistent score aggregation across pages | All score totals must use the same formula (weighted mean); grep `reduce.*score` before merging |
| Phone and chat paths diverging silently | Any prompt, scoring, or turn logic added to the chat path must be simultaneously applied to the Telnyx webhook |
| Mutation handlers not checking `res.ok` | Every `fetch()` in a save/delete handler must check `if (!res.ok)` and surface the error before calling `refresh()` |
| `gather_using_speak` with empty payload silently fails | Always pass a minimal SSML break `<speak><break time="200ms"/></speak>` — never an empty string |
| Guessing Telnyx parameter names — STT never activates | Only use parameter names from official Telnyx docs; `speech_end_timeout` (not `speech_timeout_millis`) is required to activate STT mode |

## Checklist: Before Merging a New Feature

- [ ] **All API routes and server components use raw SQL (`@neondatabase/serverless`), NOT Prisma Client**
- [ ] **All NPM packages used in API routes are verified edge-compatible (no Node.js runtime dependencies like `http`, `fs`, `crypto`)**
- [ ] **Every new `INSERT INTO` statement includes `gen_random_uuid()` for the `id` column (no DB default exists)**
- [ ] **All score/aggregate computations use weighted mean `sum(score×weight)/sum(weight)` — not simple mean**
- [ ] **Phone (Telnyx webhook) path has the same prompt, scoring, and turn logic as the chat path**
- [ ] **Every `fetch()` in an admin mutation handler checks `res.ok` before calling `refresh()`**
- [ ] All SQL queries use actual database column names from `schema.prisma` (snake_case), not Prisma field names
- [ ] All Prisma relations have `@@index` on FK columns and `onDelete` behaviour defined
- [ ] `npx prisma generate` has been run and dev server restarted after any schema change
- [ ] No `create({ include })` patterns used with the Neon HTTP adapter
- [ ] Every new API route has an auth guard as its first statement
- [ ] All queries that touch multi-tenant data include a `where: { orgId }` clause
- [ ] External API model names / config values are stored in env vars, not hard-coded
- [ ] Any message-role mapping has a unit test covering both directions
- [ ] React state is never read inside async browser event callbacks — refs are used instead
- [ ] Resource limits (turn cap, timeout) are implemented for every call to an external AI API
- [ ] Unique constraints that must be scoped per organisation use `@@unique([orgId, field])`
- [ ] New page components exceeding ~150 lines or containing async state have been refactored into hooks and sub-components
- [ ] Cloudflare build (`npx @opennextjs/cloudflare build`) has been verified after any dependency change
- [ ] DB writes introduced during setup have been verified with an explicit read-back query
- [ ] UI field access (`d.someField`) verified against exact column aliases in the API `SELECT`/`RETURNING` clause
- [ ] No hardcoded API URL paths in the UI — every `fetch('/api/...')` has a verified matching route file
- [ ] No exported functions in `src/lib/ai.ts` (or other shared libs) that have zero import sites
- [ ] **Telnyx `gather_using_speak` payload is never empty/blank string — use SSML break `<speak><break time="200ms"/></speak>`**
- [ ] **Telnyx STT gather includes `speech_end_timeout` (not `speech_timeout_millis`) + `speech_recognition_language`; test by speaking after the AI opening and listening for a response**

## Groq SDK Migration Status

**Context:** `groq-sdk@0.9.1` requires Node.js `http.Agent` API which is unavailable in Cloudflare Workers. All AI calls failed with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'maxCachedSessions')` in production.

### ✅ MIGRATION COMPLETE (2026-02-24)

**All Groq API calls successfully migrated to fetch-based client.**

**Replaced groq-sdk with custom implementation:**
- Created `src/lib/groq-fetch.ts` - Minimal Groq API client using native `fetch()`
  - `GroqFetchClient.chatCompletion()` - Non-streaming requests
  - `GroqFetchClient.chatCompletionStream()` - Server-Sent Events streaming
  - Zero Node.js dependencies, 100% Cloudflare Workers compatible

**Files Migrated:**
- `src/lib/ai.ts` - Core AI functions (generateResponse, streamResponse, scoreTranscript) [commits 8eb4ff4, d3f0b77]
- `src/app/api/debug/groq/route.ts` - Diagnostic endpoint [commit 8eb4ff4]
- `src/app/api/telnyx/webhook/route.ts` - Voice call AI responses [commit 85f50af]

**Dependencies Updated:**
- ❌ Removed `groq-sdk@0.9.1` from package.json [commit 93bc093]
- ✅ Using native Web APIs: `fetch()`, `ReadableStream`, `TextDecoder`

**Migration Timeline:**
- **Feb 24 01:30 UTC**: Discovered runtime error in production
- **Feb 24 01:40-01:55**: Attempted 4 polyfill strategies (all failed - bundler optimizes checks at build time)
- **Feb 24 01:55-02:00**: Created fetch-based client, migrated all code
- **Feb 24 02:06 UTC**: Verified working in production

**Failed Polyfill Attempts (Documented for Future Reference):**
1. Conditional polyfill (`if (!global.process?.versions?.node)`) - Never activated in Workers
2. Aggressive `globalThis.http.Agent` polyfill - Still undefined at runtime
3. Dynamic polyfill import before groq-sdk - Bundler inlined checks before polyfill executed
4. Timing-based polyfill inside async function - Same bundler optimization issue

**Root Cause:** OpenNext/esbuild bundles and optimizes code at build time. `http.Agent.maxCachedSessions` checks are inlined into bundled code, so runtime polyfills cannot patch them. The only solution is to avoid Node.js APIs entirely.

### 🔄 Migration Pattern

**Before (groq-sdk - fails in Cloudflare Workers):**
```typescript
import { getGroq } from '@/lib/ai';

const groq = await getGroq();
const completion = await groq.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
  temperature: 0.75,
  max_tokens: 400,
  stream: true,
});

for await (const chunk of completion) {
  const delta = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content;
  if (delta) yield delta;
}
```

**After (fetch-based client - works in Cloudflare Workers):**
```typescript
import { getGroqClient } from '@/lib/groq-fetch';

const client = getGroqClient();

// Non-streaming
const completion = await client.chatCompletion({
  model: 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
  temperature: 0.75,
  max_tokens: 400,
});

// Streaming
for await (const chunk of client.chatCompletionStream({
  model: 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
  temperature: 0.75,
  max_tokens: 400,
})) {
  yield chunk; // Already just the text content
}
```

**Key Conversions:**
- `await getGroq()` → `getGroqClient()` (synchronous singleton)
- `groq.chat.completions.create()` → `client.chatCompletion()`
- `stream: true` → `client.chatCompletionStream()`
- `chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content` → `chunk` (pre-extracted)
- Manual SSE parsing using `ReadableStream` + `TextDecoder`

**Production Validation:**
```bash
$ curl https://xpelevator.com/api/debug/groq
{
  "success": true,
  "response": "test successful",
  "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
}
```

## Prisma Client Migration Status

**Context:** Prisma Client is incompatible with Cloudflare Workers runtime. All production code must use raw SQL via `@neondatabase/serverless`.

### ✅ MIGRATION COMPLETE (2026-02-23)

**All production routes and server components successfully migrated to raw SQL.**

**API Routes (Production):**
- `src/app/api/jobs/route.ts` - Job title listing (GET, POST)
- `src/app/api/jobs/[id]/route.ts` - Job title details/edit (PUT, DELETE) [commit 1fe3293]
- `src/app/api/jobs/[id]/criteria/route.ts` - Job-criteria associations [commit 1fe3293]
- `src/app/api/scenarios/route.ts` - Scenario listing (GET, POST)
- `src/app/api/scenarios/[id]/route.ts` - Scenario details/edit (GET, PUT, DELETE) [commit 45a4120]

**Server Components:**
- `src/app/sessions/[id]/page.tsx` - Session detail page (SSR) [commit d35dc98]

**Auth System (CRITICAL):**
- `src/auth.ts` - NextAuth callbacks (signIn, session, jwt) [commit 135c754]

**Core Libraries:**
- `src/lib/auth-api.ts` - Authentication helper (requireAuth function) [commit 9d79ae8]
- `src/lib/db.ts` - Raw SQL client wrapper

**Migration Timeline:**
- **Feb 22**: Initial crisis - discovered Prisma Client failures in Cloudflare Workers
- **Feb 22-23**: Emergency auth system migration (commits 9d79ae8, 135c754)
- **Feb 23**: Systematic migration of all 13 production files (9 commits total)
- **Feb 23**: Migration completed - all production routes now edge-compatible

**Total Files Migrated:** 16 production files
**Total Commits:** 10 deployment commits
**Lines Changed:** ~500 insertions (raw SQL), ~300 deletions (Prisma calls)

**Impact:** Application is now fully compatible with Cloudflare Workers runtime. All routes tested and deployed to production.

### 📚 TEST/DEV FILES (Lower Priority)

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- `tests/integration/helpers/db.ts` - Test database helpers
- `tests/integration/api/*.test.ts` - Integration tests (8 files)
- `validate.mjs` - Local validation script

**Database Seeding:**
- `prisma/seed.ts` - Initial data population

**Impact:** These can continue using Prisma Client for local development/testing. Only production runtime code needs migration.

### 🔄 Migration Pattern

**Before (Prisma Client - fails in Cloudflare Workers):**
```typescript
import prisma from '@/lib/prisma';

const jobs = await prisma.jobTitle.findMany({
  where: { orgId },
  include: { scenarios: true }
});
```

**After (Raw SQL - works in Cloudflare Workers):**
```typescript
import { sql } from '@/lib/db';

const jobs = await sql`
  SELECT 
    jt.*,
    COALESCE(
      json_agg(
        json_build_object('id', s.id, 'name', s.name)
      ) FILTER (WHERE s.id IS NOT NULL),
      '[]'
    ) as scenarios
  FROM job_titles jt
  LEFT JOIN scenarios s ON s.job_title_id = jt.id
  WHERE jt.org_id = ${orgId}
  GROUP BY jt.id
`;
```

**Key Conversions:**
- `findUnique` → `SELECT ... WHERE ... LIMIT 1`
- `findMany` → `SELECT ... WHERE ...`
- `create` → `INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...) RETURNING *`
- `update` → `UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ... RETURNING *`
- `delete` → `DELETE FROM ... WHERE ... RETURNING *`
- `include` → `LEFT JOIN` + `json_build_object()` + `json_agg()`
- Relations (one-to-many) → `COALESCE(json_agg(...), '[]')`
- Relations (one-to-one) → `json_build_object(...)`

**Common Pitfalls:**
- ❌ Using Prisma field names (`jobTitleId`) → ✅ Use DB column names (`job_title_id`)
- ❌ Using `created_at` on scores table → ✅ Use `scored_at`
- ❌ Using `simulation_type` column → ✅ Use `type`
- ❌ Assuming `updated_at` exists on all tables → ✅ Only `criteria` table has it

### Migration Priority Order

1. **CRITICAL (blocking core features):**
   - `src/auth.ts` - Blocks all authenticated routes if it fails
   - `src/app/api/analytics/route.ts` - Used by main dashboard

2. **HIGH (user-facing features):**
   - `src/app/api/scoring/route.ts` - Manual scoring
   - `src/app/sessions/[id]/page.tsx` - Session review page
   - `src/app/api/scenarios/[id]/route.ts` - Scenario editing

3. **MEDIUM (admin features):**
   - `src/app/api/jobs/[id]/route.ts` - Job title management
   - `src/app/api/jobs/[id]/criteria/route.ts` - Criteria assignment
   - `src/app/api/criteria/[id]/route.ts` - Criteria editing
   - `src/app/api/orgs/*` - Organization management (3 files)

4. **LOW (future features):**
   - `src/app/api/telnyx/*` - Voice calling (2 files)
